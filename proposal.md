### Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

Our role: Data Science Team at World's Largest Wine Store (Milestii Mici)

Target audience: Customers Consuming Wine

There is a diverse array of available wines that exist on a global scale. The variety alone is enough to overwhelm the common consumer of wine products; there needs to be a way to convey key information about wine quality, type, origin and flavour pairings to help customers make informed decisions about their beverage selection. To do this, we will build a dashboard to help customers visualize the intricacies that disintguish different wines from each other in terms of quality and price. Our app will show the distribution of factors associated with sales prices and quality of wine by filtering and re-ordering on different characteristics to make direct comparisions between different types of wine. 


# Example (to be removed)
Missed medical appointments cost the healthcare system a lot of money and affects the quality of care. If we could understand what factors lead to missed appointments it may be possible to reduce their frequency. To address this challenge, we propose building a data visualization app that allows health care administrators to visually explore a dataset of missed appointments to identify common factors. Our app will show the distribution of factors contributing to appointment show/no show and allow users to explore different aspects of this data by filtering and re-ordering on different variables in order to compare factors that contribute to absence.
