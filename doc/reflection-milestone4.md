# Implementation  

- We have implemented a learn more button to show the users the importance of our app and a short guidance on how to use it
- Based from the TA feedback, we solved the crowdedness issue by reducing the number of data point and introducing a heat map
- currently, there is interactivity between the plots. In addition, we added a second bar plot
- We did some styling enhancement and improved the overall aesthetic design

# What is not working?

- At the moment, everything seems to be working fine. We included all the features we were planning to add previously. 


# Feedback 

The feedbacks we received helped us to improve our dashboard. We were happy to hear that our app was easy to use. We found some of the suggestions were crucial to milestone4. It did align with what were discussing internally. Moreover, it gave us a good perspective from the audience side. One valuable feedback was the issue of the crowded scatter plot. This helped us to decide to reduce the data points and add a hat map for better interpretation.


#  R/ggplotly or Python/Altair?

This was the easiest decision we made in this project. Altair is more freindly user. Styling and coloring in altair is much better than ggplotly. Moreover, we were having connectivity issue between Rstudio and the app. 

# Conclusion

This project was fun. We learned a lot from it and we definitely enhanced our working collaboratively skills. Compared to the advanced dashboards, our app looks primitive. However, we're so proud of this achievement. One big challenge we faced is introducing images to the dashboard. The implementing process was not easy and not covered in the course. This would have improved the design of the app immensely.
