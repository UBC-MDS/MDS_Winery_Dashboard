In this section, your group should document on what you have implemented in your dashboard so far and explain what is not yet implemented. It is important that you include what you know is not working in your dashboard, so that your TAs can distinguish between features in development and bugs. Since this is the last milestone, you really need to motivate well why you have not chosen to include some feature that you were planning on including previously.

This week it is suitable to include thoughts on the feedback you received from your peer and/or TA, e.g.

Has it been easy to use your app?
Are there reoccurring themes in your feedback on what is good and what can be improved?
Is there any feedback (or other insight) that you have found particularly valuable during your dashboard development?
This section should be around 300-500 words and the reflection-milestone4.md document should live in your GitHub.com repo in the doc folder.
