This file documentes what this app has been implemented in the dashboard so far, as well as what features have not been done yet.

## App Strengths
- This well-implemented dashboard is able to let customers filter the wine product from their desired states in US and wine variety, using the left-side dropdown manu. In addition, two sliders among price and rating points would enable customers to narrow down their selection and compare products within this range.
- The choropleth map of united states on the top works as a heatmap of reviews showing the location of the selected state. Moreover, interactive feature has also been added by showing the average rating, price, value(price per point) and number of reviews.
- If a customer want to compare the average price among the selected wine types, the bar chart will be very informative on this. The scatter plot of rating points versus price reveals the possible relationship between both.
- Finally customers can easily find the recommendation of wine products on the given two cards, which are either highest value or highest rating points.

## App Limitations
- So far, some shortcomings of this dashboard are the limitation to the united states only, even though the dataset sampled the global data.
- Furthermore, due to the lack of sufficient wine science knowledge or well-sourced database to join, the wine variety is unable to be grouped well with tremendously large range to select from. 
- One assumption was made that the wine products with missing value of prices or ratings are sold out already.

## Future Improvements or Thing to Fix
- The selection of states and wine variety can be sorted alphabetically, so customers can easily find the desired combinations.
- Since there is missing data in some states and wine types, the errors keep poping up in dashaborad. This should be better fixed in the future milestones.
- The summary cards are not updated and displayed properly when multiple wines have been selected, which will need adding functionality later.
- Multiple states selction has not been implemented, and will be tested further how this can be in effect.
- Concise introduction as text on this dashboard could help customers how to nevigate and read in the map and graphs. 
- Possible aesthetic styling on the interface can better improve the user experience with proper font style/size and color scheme, etc.
- For the interactivity, it could be better improved by connecting three graphs together and showing the corresponding values.
